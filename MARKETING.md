# Reddzit

**Reddit is massive. Your time isn't.**

I built Reddzit because I was tired of opening Reddit and losing an hour to content I didn't care about. The front page is optimized for engagement, not for *me*. I wanted a tool that understood what I actually find valuable and surfaced only that.

Reddzit analyzes your saved posts to build a persona of your real interests, then curates a feed weighted to what matters to you. No algorithmic rage-bait. No infinite scroll into irrelevance. Just the posts, discussions, and communities that match how you actually spend your attention.

Beyond the feed, it gives you tools to *do something* with what you read. Save quotes from any page with a browser extension. Organize them into stories. Get an AI-generated daily briefing with sentiment analysis so you can catch up on trending discussions in minutes instead of hours. Customize the entire interface down to the color palette and typography so it feels like yours.

It's Reddit, rebuilt around a simple question: **what if your feed respected your time?**

# Reddzit

**You already curate the internet. Now do something with it.**

Every time you hit save on a Reddit post, upvote a comment, or highlight a passage that resonates, you're making an editorial decision. But those moments disappear into a graveyard of saved posts you never revisit and bookmarks you forget you made.

Reddzit turns that instinct into a system. Your saved posts, your comments, the quotes you highlight with the browser extension — they all flow into one place where you can actually work with them. Tag and annotate quotes. Group them into stories. Build something from the fragments of insight you collect every day instead of letting them rot in a tab you closed three weeks ago.

It's a personal knowledge tool disguised as a Reddit client. The feed is there, smarter and tailored to you, but the real value is what happens after you read. Reddzit is for people who don't just consume content — they collect it, think about it, and want a place to turn scattered ideas into something coherent.
